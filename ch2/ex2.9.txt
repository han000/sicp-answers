Exercise 2.9

Part 1:

The width of an interval can be given by:
    w = (u - l) / 2
where u = upper bound
      l = lower bound

The sum of two intervals is given by:
    (l1, u1) + (l2, u2) = (l1 + l2, u1 + u2)

where (lower bound, upper bound) describes an interval.

The widths of the two intervals we are adding are given by:
    w1 = (u1 - l1) / 2
    w2 = (u2 - l2) / 2


The width of the result of summing two intervals is therefore:
    w = ((u1 + u2) - (l1 + l2)) / 2
      = (u1 - l1 + u2 - l2) / 2
      = (u1 - l2) / 2 + (u2 - l2) / 2
      = w1 + w2

So we can see that the width of the result of the addition of two intervals is
given by the sum of the widths of those intervals.


Part 2:

We can show that width of the result of a multiplication is not a function of
only the widths of the two operands by giving an example of two cases where the
input operands have the same width but the outputs have different widths.

e.g. here the inputs all have width 1
    (1, 2) * (1, 2) = (1, 4)
output has width 3/2

    (0, 1) * (0, 1) = (0, 1)
output has width 1/2
